What is Galaxy Tool Generator (GTG)?
-------------------------------------

GTG is a `Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/>`_ based web application which enables developing and publishing
Galaxy tools through web interfaces. This web application consists of two Drupal modules: `galaxy_tool_generator_ui <https://github.com/MingChen0919/galaxy_tool_generator_ui>`_ and `galaxy_tool_generator <https://github.com/MingChen0919/galaxy_tool_generator_ui>`_, and
depends on the `Drupal webform <https://www.drupal.org/project/webform>`_ module.
